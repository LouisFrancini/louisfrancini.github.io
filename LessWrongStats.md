# LessWrong and EA Forum Posts per Year

LessWrong and the EA Forum both provide a [GraphQL API](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LJiGhpq8w4Badr5KJ/graphql-tutorial-for-lesswrong-and-effective-altruism-forum). We can use this API to extract statistics on the number of posts created per year.

# Number of posts over time
[Here](https://gist.github.com/LouisFrancini/45ba6673b2aee67f69f3581daa66c9e0) is some simple code that can be used to produce statistics on the number of top-level posts. This includes front page posts, community posts, meta-posts, questions, link posts, and events. It excludes shortform posts.

Note that some early posts have dates prior to the creation of the forum. This is because, early on, the post dates were manually modified to reflect when the pieces were written rather than their posting dates to the forum. For example, Yudkowsky's [guide to Bayes's theorem](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XTXWPQSEgoMkAupKt/an-intuitive-explanation-of-bayes-s-theorem) is dated as from 2003, because that is when it was [originally posted to his personal website](http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes/).
